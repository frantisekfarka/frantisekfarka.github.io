Call for Papers

Workshop on
 Coalgebra, Horn Clause Logic Programming and Types

28-29 November 2016, Edinburgh, UK
https://ff32.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/lpti16/

===================================================

The workshop marks the end of the EPSRC Grant Coalgebraic Logic Programming for
Type Inference, by K. Komendantskaya and J. Power and will consist of two parts:

    Part 1 - Semantics: Lawvere theories and Coalgebra in Logic and Functional
        Programming
    Part 2 - Programming languages: Horn Clause Logic for Type Inference in
        Functional Languages and Beyond

We invite all colleagues working in related areas to submit and share their
results.


Venue 
-----

The workshop will be held at the International Center for Mathematical Sciences,
in Edinburgh city center, just 2 minutes walk from the Informatics Forum.
