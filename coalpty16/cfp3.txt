Call for Participation

Workshop on
  Coalgebra, Horn Clause Logic Programming and Types

28-29 November 2016, Edinburgh, UK
https://ff32.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/coalpty16/


Abstract submission:    15 October, 2016
Registration deadline:  5 November, 2016

====================================================

Objectives and scope
-------------------

The workshop marks the end of the EPSRC Grant Coalgebraic Logic Programming for
Type Inference, by K. Komendantskaya and J. Power and will consist of two parts:

        Part 1 - Semantics: Lawvere theories and Coalgebra in Logic and
        Functional Programming

        Part 2 - Programming languages: Horn Clause Logic for Type Inference in
        Functional Languages and Beyond

We invite all colleagues working in related areas to present and share their
results. We envisage a friendly meeting with many stimulating discussions, and
therefore  welcome presentations of already published research as well as novel
results. Authors of original contributions will be invited to submit their
papers to EPTCS post-proceedings. We especially encourage early career
researchers to present and participate.

Venue 
-----

The workshop will be held at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences,
in Edinburgh city centre, just 2 minutes walk from the Informatics Forum.
